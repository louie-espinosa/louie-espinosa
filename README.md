### Hey there, Hi there, Ho there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning Classes in JavaScript, as well as JavaScript libraries/frameworks, like React, JQuery, and how to use API calls with Artificial Intelligence
- 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that helps grow my knowledge and aids others in doing the same
