### Hi there 👋

<!--
**louie-espinosa/louie-espinosa** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a cardgame that uses HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning classes in JavaScript
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps grow my knowledge and aids others in doing the same
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with excelling and teaching others how to do the same
- 💬 Ask me about my love of all music, including classical, rap, soul, R&B, Jazz, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: laespinosa@pm.me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to sing, and have participated in karaoke in Mexico, Japan, Denmark, and the US. I even won the grand prize of $500 in a karaoke competition in Whittier, CA
